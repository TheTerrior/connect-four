# Connect Four AI
A self-learning AI for Connect Four. Additionally, player vs player functionality is available.

## Training Method
This AI is trained using a genetic algorithm, complete with mutations and sexual reproduction. The AI runs partially on CUDA, so an NVIDIA card is required (possible CPU implementation later).
